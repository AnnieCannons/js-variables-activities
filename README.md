# Variables in JavaScript

## Declaring a variable

- Declaring a variable in JavaScript is the process of creating a container to store data. Variables allow you to hold values of various types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. They provide a way to store data temporarily in memory so that you can use and manipulate it later in your code.

- To declare a variable in JavaScript, you use the let or const keyword (var is also a keyword that can be used, sparingly) followed by the variable name. The syntax for declaring a variable is as follows:
    - `let userAge`;
    - `const daysOfTheWeek`;


## Assigning a Variable
- Assigning a variable in JavaScript means giving it a value. Once you declare a variable, you can assign a specific value to it or update its value at any time during the execution of your code.

- To assign a value to a variable in JavaScript, you use the assignment operator (=). The syntax for assigning a variable is as follows:
    - `let userAge;`
    - `let userName;`
    - `const PI = 3.14159;`

- Assigning values to variables
    - `userAge = 25;`
    - `userName = "Marc Antony";`

- Constants are assigned a value when declared
    - `const daysInWeek = 7;`

- Variables can be assigned different values later
    - `age = 30;`
    - `name = "Cleopatra";`

### Prep
    1. Connect your js file to your HTML file
    2. Open your code in the browser and open your console

### Exerise 1
    1. Look at the figma_design file in the assets folder of this repo.
    2. List all of the possible variables that exist on the page, and declare them as variables.

### Exerise 2
    - Declaring variables is an important way to work with data in your JavaScript file.
    1. Follow the instructions in th `scripts.js` file for declaring variables. 

### Exerise 3
    - You will need to be able to reassign the values of a variable. This can be helpful when working with different datasets.
    1. Take the strings listed and make sure that they are formatted property. 
    2. Follow the instructions in th `scripts.js` file for reassigning variables.  

### Exerise 4
    - This exercise will have you working with `const`.
    1. Follow the instructions in th `scripts.js` file for declaring const variables.
