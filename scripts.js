/************************ Exercise 1 - Identify Variables ************************/

// Declare Variables Here
let totalSales;
let totalExpense;
let totalProfit;
let salesBreakDown;
let customerDemoGraph;
let salesBreakDown2;
let color1 = "blue";
let color2 = "purple";
let color3 = "green";








/************************ Exercise 2 - Declaring Variables ************************/

// Declare three variables named firstName, lastName, and age. Assign your own values to each variable. 
let firstName = "Lav";
let lastName = "Based";
let age = "100,000,000";

// Log the variables' values to the console.
console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);
console.log(age);

















/************************ Exercise 3 - Swapping Variables  ************************/

// Create two variables, a and b, and assign them any values.
let a = "Rice";
console.log(a);

let b = "Beans";
console.log(b);

let side =  a;

// Swap the values of a and b. You may use a third variable to hold a value so you don't overwrite it. Use reassignment—don't change the previous lines of code!

a = b;
console.log(a)
b = side;
console.log(b);

// Log the values of a and b before and after the swap.

console.log(a);
console.log(b);

















/************************ Exercise 4 - Working with Constants ************************/

// Declare a constant variable named PI and set its value to 3.14159. 
const PI = "3.14159";

// Then, attempt to reassign a new value to PI. 
// ⭐️ let PI = "9.99999999";


// Observe the error in the console and write a comment here explaining why you can't reassign a constant.
//⭐️It's a constant variable meaning it's strictly going to make reference to one specific value. It's the opposite of insanity.
//⭐️The value of the const variable cannot be changed
