/************************ Exercise 1 - Identify Variables ************************/

// Declare Variables Here
let totalSales;
let totalProfit;
let totalExpense;
let Employes;
let AgeGroup;
let Bundels;
let locations;
let status;
let spent;
let costConversation;










/************************ Exercise 2 - Declaring Variables ************************/

// Declare three variables named firstName, lastName, and age. Assign your own values to each variable. 

let firstName = 'Dorcus';
let lastName = 'Nagadya'
let age = '27';

// Log the variables' values to the console.

console.log(firstName,lastName, age);




/************************ Exercise 3 - Swapping Variables  ************************/

// Create two variables, a and b, and assign them any values.
let a = 7;
let b = 5;
 console.log(a,b);

// Swap the values of a and b. You may use a third variable to hold a value so you don't overwrite it. Use reassignmentâ€”don't change the previous lines of code!

a = b;
console.log(a);
let temp = 7;
console.log(temp);
b = temp
console.log(a);
// Log the values of a and b before and after the swap.


console.log(a,b);


/************************ Exercise 4 - Working with Constants ************************/

// Declare a constant variable named PI and set its value to 3.14159. 
const pi = 3.14159
// Then, attempt to reassign a new value to PI. 
pi = 4.14159
// Observe the error in the console and write a comment here explaining why you can't reassign a constant.
 // becouse its constant, we could use let instead.
