/************************ Exercise 2 - Declaring Variables ************************/

// Declare three variables named firstName, lastName, and age. Assign your own values to each variable. 


firstName = "Hailey";
lastName = "Gerhard";
age = 26;

// Log the variables' values to the console.

console.log("Logging information");
console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);
console.log(age);




/************************ Exercise 3 - Swapping Variables  ************************/

// Create two variables, a and b, and assign them any values.

// Swap the values of a and b. You may use a third variable to hold a value so you don't overwrite it. Use reassignmentâ€”don't change the previous lines of code!

// Log the values of a and b before and after the swap.

let a = 3;
let b = 4;

console.log(a)
console.log(b)

let c = a;
a = b;
b = c;

console.log(a)
console.log(b)

/************************ Exercise 4 - Working with Constants ************************/

// Declare a constant variable named PI and set its value to 3.14159. 

const PI = 3.14159;

// Then, attempt to reassign a new value to PI. 

// PI = 3.123; //

// Observe the error in the console and write a comment here explaining why you can't reassign a constant.
 // comment: the value has already been assigned/declared for PI meaning I can't reassign the value going forward //
