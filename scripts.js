/************************ Exercise 1 - Identify Variables ************************/

// Declare Variables Here
let totalSales;
let totalExpense;
let totalProfit;
let ageGroup;
let customerLocation;
let name;
let status;
let spent;
let salesReturn;
let costConversion;
let costClick;
let ctr;
let action;









/************************ Exercise 2 - Declaring Variables ************************/

// Declare three variables named firstName, lastName, and age. Assign your own values to each variable. 
let firstName = "Taylor";
console.log(firstName);
let lastName = "Lange";
console.log(lastName);
let age = "28";
console.log(age)


// Log the variables' values to the console.





/************************ Exercise 3 - Swapping Variables  ************************/

// Create two variables, a and b, and assign them any values.

let a = "apples";
console.log(a)
let b = "bananas";
console.log(b)

// Swap the values of a and b. You may use a third variable to hold a value so you don't overwrite it. Use reassignmentâ€”don't change the previous lines of code!

a = b;
console.log(a);
let temp = "apples";
console.log(temp);
a = temp
console.log(a);
// Log the values of a and b before and after the swap.





/************************ Exercise 4 - Working with Constants ************************/

// Declare a constant variable named PI and set its value to 3.14159. 

const PI = "3.14159";

// Then, attempt to reassign a new value to PI. 

//PI = "5";

// Observe the error in the console and write a comment here explaining why you can't reassign a constant.

// Constant variables cannot be reassigned values, because "const" is a fixed declaration. In order to reassign a value to a variable, you must use "let".
